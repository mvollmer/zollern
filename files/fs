;; Files never change once they have been completely written.  Files
;; that have not yet been completely written can not be found by name.
;; Writing a file with the same name as an existing file will replace

;;
;; Releases the file described by BUF.
;;
;; - (fs/read buf)
;;
;; Updates BUF to describe the next chunk of its file.  Returns zero
