@** Das boot

This book gets everything started.

It can be changed and recompiled while Zollern is running, like any
other book.  However, there is no other way to actually run its code
than to restart Zollern completely.

@* Entry point

The bootstrap compiler will transfer control to [code boot/start].

@=
(fun (boot/start)
  (mem/init)
  (fs/init)
  (gfx/init)
  (shell/main)
  (gfx/loop)
  (dbg/out "HALT\n"))
