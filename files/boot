@** Das Boot

This book gets everything started.

It can be changed and recompiled while Zollern is running, like any
other book.  However, there is no other way to actually run its code
than to restart Zollern completely.

@* Entry point

The bootstrap compiler in the [book comp1 Z1 Compiler] book will transfer control
to [code boot/start].

@=
(fun (boot/start)
  (mem/init)
  (log/init)
  (fs/init)
  (gfx/init)
  (ui/init)
  (shell/main-loop)
  (sys/halt))
@

Running this book will trigger a reboot. This is done with a magic
exit code recognized by [code zfb].

@=
(fun (boot/main)
  (sys/restart))
