@** Z2 Assembler

The level two assembler is a API to create [emph books] of machine
code and other constant data. We will not be writing long assembler
programs (like we did for the Z1 compiler), but the Z2 compiler
will use this API in its backend to emit the actual machine instructions.

@* Books

@=
(struct asm/book
  bk-next-page
  bk-name
  bk-refcount)

(fun (asm/book-new name)
  )

(fun (asm/book-ref book)
  )

(fun (asm/book-unref book)
  )

(fun (asm/alloc book size)
  )

(fun (asm/begin state book)
  )

(fun (asm/end state)
  )

(fun (asm/emit-8 state val)
  )

(fun (asm/emit-16 state val)
  )

(fun (asm/emit-32 state val)
  )

(fun (asm/emit-64 state val)
  )

(fun (asm/emit-add state a b)
  )

(fun (asm/emit-add-i state a val)
  )
