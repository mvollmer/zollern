@** Programming languages

Zollern has a primitive bootstrap language called Z1 that is only
used to implement ... everything. There is no other language
yet, but there likely will be in the future.

The current plan for Z2 is to be pretty much the same kind of
language as Z1 (low-level with manual memory management), but
better. Easier to read implementation, some optimizations, simple
static type system, better error messages.

(And Z3 is then going to be a dynamic language will all the goodies.
Automatic memory management, concurrency, strong types.)
