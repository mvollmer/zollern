@** Example

This is an example of a wonderful [bold Zollern] book. It has descriptive
sections alternating with sections of code.

Zoller requires us to define functions before they are used, but
we really need to talk about the magic of foo first.

So let's define what we mean by [code <foo>]. It will all make
sense later.

@* Part One - foo

Behold:

@= <foo>
"foo" 12

@* Part Two - main

Now we can reveal the main program, which has some functions,
the last of which is [code TEXT/main], as expected.

@=
<define utility functions>

(fun (TEXT/main)
  (TEXT/hello)
  (TEXT/debug <foo>))

@* Part Three - utilities

Not a lot going on here. You probably have guessed it: this is
all just a test for the literate programming features of Zollern.

@= <define utility functions>
(fun (TEXT/debug l v)
  (log/msg "%s: %d\n" l v))

@
But let's have one more utility.

@= <define utility functions>
(fun (TEXT/hello msg)
  (log/write "Hello, Zollern!\n"))
