@** Example 
This is an example of a wonderful [b Zollern] book. It has descriptive
sections alternating with sections of code.

@=

<Painting functions>

(fun (TEXT/main)
  12)
@

Back to text.

@= <Painting functions>

(fun (TEXT/paint)
  12)
@
And another paragraph. This goes on for a bit longer because why
not. Paragraphs should be more than one line, I'd say.

@* Part Two

More interesting things about code, maybe about [code TEXT/main].
