@** Example 

This is an example of a wonderful [b Zollern] book. It has descriptive
sections alternating with sections of code.

@=
(fun (TEXT/main)
  (dbg/int "foo" <foo>))
@

Back to text, to define the magical value of [code <foo>].

@= <foo>
12
@

And another paragraph. This goes on for a bit longer because why
not. Paragraphs should be more than one line, I'd say.

@* Part Two

More interesting things about code, maybe about [code TEXT/main].
