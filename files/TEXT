@** Example

This is an example of a wonderful [b Zollern] book. It has descriptive
sections alternating with sections of code. 

@=
(fun (TEXT/main)
  12)
@
 
Back to text.

And another paragraph. This goes on for a bit longer because why
not. Paragraphs should be more than one line, I'd say.

@* Part Two

More interesting things about code, maybe about [code TEXT/main].
