@** User interfaces

The user interface of Zollern is constructed from rectangular
areas of the screen, called [emph elements]. There are different
kinds of elements, such as buttons or text inputs. In fact, each
application is implemented as a new kind of element.

Elements form a tree: One element is the root and covers the whole
screen, the sub-elements of that are the applications and the
navigation panel, and then there might be buttons etc within
those.

@* Element objects

Although there are many different kinds of concrete user interface
elements, they all share common features and behavior. Namely,
a element knows where it is on the screen, whether it is currently
visible, what its relations are in the tree of elements, and
some other bits of information. This state of an element is stored
in its [emph fields]. For example, the size of an element is
stored in the [code ui/elt-width] and [code ui/elt-height] fields.

Each element also has a fixed number of things that you can do
with it, called its [emph methods]: You can draw it by invoking
its [emph paint] method, and you can send an input event to it
with the [emph input] method. And although each element can do
these things, each kind does it differently.

New kinds of elements are defined by [emph deriving] a new kind
from an existing [emph base] kind. While doing this, you need
to provide concrete functions that implement each of the methods
of the base element. It is very common to add more fields when
defining a new kind of element, to store the state that is needed
to do its job. You can also add more methods, but this is less
common (and more cumbersome).

The [book app] book explains how to derive a new application kind
in detail.

@* Base elements

Let's start with the [code ui/element] structure that is shared
by all elements. It's pretty big as far as Zollern is concerned.

@=
(struct ui/element
  -elt-functions
  -elt-next
  -elt-subs
  -elt-x
  -elt-y
  (-elt-flag1 u8)
  (-elt-needs-paint u8)
  (-elt-flag3 u8)
  (-elt-flag4 u8)
  (elt-can-focus u8)
  (elt-has-focus u8)
  (-elt-flag7 u8)
  (-elt-flag8 u8)
  elt-width
  elt-height)
@

You can find the links in it that form the tree of elements, and
the fields that store where the element is positioned on the
screen. The first field, [code -elt-functions], contains a pointer
to the table of method functions, created by [code book/funtab].

@=
(struct ui/element-function-table-type
  -eltf-book
  -eltf-init
  -eltf-fini
  -eltf-paint
  -eltf-input)
@

Function tables are supposed to be defined with the [code ui/element-functions]
macro instead of with [code book/funtab] directly. This way,
you get a syntax error when you forget a function.

@=
(def (ui/element-functions ?name ?init ?fini ?paint ?input)
  (book/funtab ?name ?init ?fini ?paint ?input))
@

Creating new element instances is done with [code ui/new]. We
need some memory for the new instance and then call the [emph
init] method to turn the raw memory into the instance. Initialization
often needs some arguments, so [code ui/new] takes five arbitrary
ones and passes them on to the [emph init] method. You only need
to really pass as many as you need. Pointers, numbers, anything
is fine. The Z1 language doesn't check anything.

The given table of method functions is installed in the new instance,
of course. The reference count of its book is increased to make
sure that the functions actually stay around as long as the instance
does.

@=
(fun (ui/new size functions arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4 arg5)
  (var inst (mem/alloc size))
  (book/funtab-ref functions)
  (set (ui/-elt-functions inst) functions)
  ((ui/-eltf-init functions) inst arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4 arg5)
  inst)
@

Freeing is the exact reverse. Note that there is no help here
regarding when to free an element. You must make sure that the
element is not part of the tree when it is freed, and also not
referenced in other ways, such as being the one that currently
has the keyboard focus.

@=
(fun (ui/free inst)
  ((ui/-eltf-fini (ui/-elt-functions inst)) inst)
  (book/funtab-unref (ui/-elt-functions inst))
  (mem/free inst))
@

And here are the functions for the [emph init] and [emph fini]
methods of the base element. Initialization sets (almost) all
fields to zero, and finalization actually does nothing.

@=
(fun (ui/element-init inst)
  (set (ui/-elt-next inst) 0)
  (set (ui/-elt-subs inst) 0)
  (set (ui/elt-can-focus inst) 0)
  (set (ui/elt-has-focus inst) 0))

(fun (ui/element-fini inst))

@* The element tree

Elements are put into action by making them part of the global
user interface element tree. This tree is constructed anew every
time the event loop draws all elements to the screen, starting
with the root.

The function for the [emph paint] method of an element draws whatever
it needs, and also constructs the element tree below it by calling
[code ui/paint] for all its sub-elements. The sub-elements are
usually created in the [emph init] method function and freed
in the [emph fini] method function, but they can of course also
be created dynamically in response to input events, etc.

After the painting is done, the event loop reads the next input
event and uses the tree that has been constructed during the
previous painting phase to decide to which element to deliver
the event.

@=
(fun (ui/paint inst sub x y w h)
  (if (inst
       (set (ui/-elt-next sub) (ui/-elt-subs inst))
       (set (ui/-elt-subs inst) sub)
       (set x (+ x (ui/-elt-x inst)))
       (set y (+ y (ui/-elt-y inst)))))
  (set (ui/-elt-x sub) x)
  (set (ui/-elt-y sub) y)
  (set (ui/elt-width sub) w)
  (set (ui/elt-height sub) h)
  (set (ui/-elt-subs sub) 0)
  (gfx/set-window x y w h)
  ((ui/-eltf-paint (ui/-elt-functions sub)) sub)
  (set (ui/-elt-needs-paint sub) 0))
@

Actually, painting does not always start with the root, but with
those elements of the current tree that have the [emph paint-needed]
flag set. Thus, if a button element receives a button press event
and wants to be rendered in a depressed state, it will set its
own [emph paint-needed] flag and the next paint phase will only
draw the button.

@=
(fun (ui/paint-needed inst)
  (set (ui/-elt-needs-paint inst) 1))
@

And here is the function that the event loop calls to find the
elements that need painting.

@=
(fun (ui/paint-if-needed inst)
  (if ((ui/-elt-needs-paint inst)
       (gfx/set-window (ui/-elt-x inst) (ui/-elt-y inst)
                       (ui/elt-width inst) (ui/elt-height inst))
       (gfx/clear)
       (set (ui/-elt-subs inst) 0)
       ((ui/-eltf-paint (ui/-elt-functions inst)) inst)
       (set (ui/-elt-needs-paint inst) 0))
      (else
       (var sub (ui/-elt-subs inst))
       (while sub
         (ui/paint-if-needed sub)
         (set sub (ui/-elt-next sub))))))
@

@* Keyboard focus

Keyboard events are delivered to the [emph focus] element. When
the event loop reads a press event of the first mouse button,
the element under the mouse pointer becomes the focus element,
if it has the [emph can-focus] flag set. If not, its closest
parent in the element tree that has this flag set, will become
the focus element. You can also call [code ui/set-focus] to manage
it explicitly.

The [code ui/set-focus] function communicates with the event loop
via some global state in the context. This needs to work also
before the event loop has actually started running, so we initialize
it early enough during boot.

@=
(struct ui/context
  c-focus)

(fun (ui/init)
  (var c (mem/alloc ui/context))
  (set (ctxt/ui context) c)
  (set (ui/c-focus c) 0))

(fun (ui/set-focus inst)
  (var c (ctxt/ui context))
  (if ((ui/c-focus c)
       (set (ui/elt-has-focus (ui/c-focus c)) 0)
       (ui/paint-needed (ui/c-focus c))))
  (set (ui/c-focus c) inst)
  (if (inst
       (set (ui/elt-has-focus inst) 1)
       (ui/paint-needed inst))))
@

As you can see above, the current focus element has the [emph
has-focus] flag set. It's [emph paint] method function should
use this to indicate this fact to the user by drawing a cursor,
for example.

All parents of the focus element in the element tree have their
[emph contains-focus] flag set. This is used to determine whether
the shell or the current application has the focus, for example.

@=
(fun (ui/elt-contains-focus inst)
  (if ((ui/elt-has-focus inst)
       1)
      (else
       (var sub (ui/-elt-subs inst))
       (while sub
         (if ((ui/elt-contains-focus sub)
              (goto done)))
         (set sub (ui/-elt-next sub)))
       (label done)
       (if (sub 1) (else 0)))))

@* Pointer events

Mouse button presses are delivered to the element under the mouse.
We need a function to find that element. It will also find the
closest element that can get the keyboard focus,

@=
(struct ui/query-result
  qr-focus
  qr-top)

(fun (ui/query-xy inst x y res)
  (if ((and (>= x (ui/-elt-x inst))
            (>= y (ui/-elt-y inst))
            (< x (+ (ui/-elt-x inst) (ui/elt-width inst)))
            (< y (+ (ui/-elt-y inst) (ui/elt-height inst))))
       (if ((ui/elt-can-focus inst)
            (set (ui/qr-focus res) inst)))
       (set (ui/qr-top res) inst)
       (var sub (ui/-elt-subs inst))
       (while (and sub (not (ui/query-xy sub x y res)))
         (set sub (ui/-elt-next sub)))
       1)
      (else
       0)))
@

@* Event loop

The event loop has been mention a couple of times already. It
is an actual loop that reads a input event and passes it on to
the [emph input] method of the appropriate element. It also paints
all elements when necessary and pushes the framebuffer out to
the display.

The event loop also recognizes simple [emph mouse gestures]. A
button press will [emph grab] the element under the mouse, and
all subsequent mouse events continue to be delivered to that
element until the button is released again. If the pointer is
actually in the grab element, the event state will have the [code
gfx/ev-state-inside] flag set.

The [code ui/button] element uses this, for example.

@=
(fun (ui/loop root global-input-handler global-input-data)
  (var control-x-prefix 0)
  (var grab 0)
  (var gfx (ctxt/gfx context))
  (gfx/reset-win gfx)
  (gfx/clear)
  (ui/paint 0 root 0 0 (gfx/gfx-screen-width gfx) (gfx/gfx-screen-height gfx))
  (while 1
    (gfx/show-and-get)
    (mem event gfx/event)
    (gfx/read-event event)
    (if ((== (gfx/ev-type event) 1)
         (sys/exit 0))
        ((== (gfx/ev-type event) 3)
         (gfx/resize (gfx/ev-x event) (gfx/ev-y event)))
        ((== (gfx/ev-type event) 2)
         (var state (gfx/ev-state event))
         (var input (gfx/ev-input event))
         (var x (gfx/ev-x event))
         (var y (gfx/ev-y event))
         (if ((and (<= input gfx/ev-button-1-press)
                   (>= input gfx/ev-scroll-down))
              (mem res ui/query-result)
              (set (ui/qr-focus res) 0)
              (set (ui/qr-top res) 0)
              (if ((ui/query-xy root x y res)
                   (var top (ui/qr-top res))
                   (var c (ctxt/ui context))
                   (if ((== input gfx/ev-button-1-press)
                        (ui/set-focus (ui/qr-focus res))
                        (set grab top))
                       (else
                        (if ((== top grab)
                             (set state (bit-or state gfx/ev-state-inside))))
                        (if (grab
                             (set top grab)))
                        (if ((== input gfx/ev-button-1-release)
                             (set grab 0)))))
                   ((ui/-eltf-input (ui/-elt-functions top))
                    top state input (- x (ui/-elt-x top)) (- y (ui/-elt-y top))))))
             ((and (not control-x-prefix) (== state gfx/ev-state-control) (== input ch/x))
              (set control-x-prefix 1))

                  (else
                   (var target (ui/c-focus (ctxt/ui context)))
                   (if (target
                        ((ui/-eltf-input (ui/-elt-functions target)) target state input x y)))))
              (set control-x-prefix 0)))))
    (ui/paint-if-needed root)))
@

@* Buttons

Buttons are user interface elements that call a given function
when they are "clicked". A "click" is a mouse gesture where the
mouse button is pressed in the button element and the pointer
is still (or again) in the same element. If the mouse button
is released while the pointer is outside of the element, no "click"
is registered and the callback function is not called.

Text inputs are user interface elements that allow the editing
