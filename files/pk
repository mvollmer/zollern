@** Debugging

This is a trivial book that only exists to get cute names like
[code pk/int]. The "pk" abbreviates "peek".

The function defined here are meant to be inserted into code while
debugging, to get a trace of what is going on. For example, one
might temporarily change

@c
(var x (math/random 1000))
@
to
@c
(var x (pk/int "x" (math/random 1000)))
@
to get a trace of the values of [code x] as the program runs.
The output appears in the log.

Here are the two functions, one for numbers, the other for strings.

@=
(fun (pk/int label num)
  (log/msg "%s: %d\n" label num)
  n)

(fun (pk/str label str)
  (log/msg "%s: %s\n" label str)
  str)
@
